## Documentation
Based off of Ashley's description of the current way to contribute to the showcase project, see showcase_documentation.md

## Testing
David: has never used git before or done html and css
- should I have a git tutorial/html and css mini tutorial within the show case documentation or does that detract/overcomplicate it in actuality?
- would maintainers be anyone or people w/ pre-req in html/css

Changes to be implemented based off of testing:
Documentation improvements:
Explain how to navigate to directory
- screenshot terminal navigating to p5js/explain cloning
Explain how to clone something on GitHub
change html terminal link
Donâ€™t understand the create a new reference to a new handlebars file stuff (vague)
- screenshot where in index.hbs to insert link to new file
A video of someone adding a new entry?
- p5.js-website master should be taken out of the how to set up repo

## YAML -> JSON experiments
- YAML to JSON array formatting is straight-forward
- I'm confused how to load json remotely
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON
most tutorials use an external html, and a video I watched said you needed a server like grunt or something to bring it in
- I'm confused how to link fetch to json path?? bc the api says url..., so for now I just put it in a variable in the javascript
