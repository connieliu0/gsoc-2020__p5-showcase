Began timeline, also finalizing the forms and UI this week.

Three different pull requests:
1) with updating form for summer 2020's showcase
- Q: should I change the text too? Or just change the form link only. If I change the text, that means part of the translation is incorrect, so should I replace the translation?

2) with updated tag UI
3) with updated UI per showcase page
4) with categories?

YAML formatting update
- Emailed Kenneth and Aaron about it, waiting for responses as to if they have any deeper insights
- Kenneth says it might be a dead end, waiting on Aaron.

External website updates:
TBD

Community updates:
- sent updated form to Ashley and spoke with friends for feedback
