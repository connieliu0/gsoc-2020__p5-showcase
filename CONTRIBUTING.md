# Contributing

This is a repo designed specifically for Connie's GSoC 2020 project. If you'd like to fork this repo or clone it for your own GSoC mentorship or organization, please feel free to do so.

Suggestions and issue submissions are welcome, but we are not actively seeking contributors at the moment since this is mostly for our own internal organization.

Thank you!
