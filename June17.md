# # Going Through the Tutorials and Thoughts
p5.js adding tags
- added tags inside the Article!: https://editor.p5js.org/connieliu/sketches/T8FNqZ6-9


# # Projects to look into
Current Projects as they fit under "categories":
- art
  - Moving Responsive Posters
- games
  - Airi Flies
- tutorial
  - Qtv
  - p5.js shaders
- code
- design
  - Programmed Plotter drawings
  - Chillin
- tool?
Should we consolidate art/design into -> visual and writing?

Proposal consolidate tool into code? Because a lot of software heavy projects are also tools.

New projects to add based off of current responses (see https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2cKRC161AZgrhG4yxeqeu5tQtT3EHBbf3yrhLYhr84/edit#gid=1168564708)
- game
  - Kunaile, Pink Pong?
- art
 - teduur? but can't find the repository

Hello!
My name is Connie Liu and I'm currently in charge of maintaining and expanding the Showcase under Google Summer of Code! I noticed that your work is an interesting and unique use of p5.js and would love to feature your work in the Showcase! For more context, the p5.js showcase, which can be viewed at http://p5js.org/showcase, is a collection of art, design, tools, and more intended to show the wide variety of projects that can be made!
I've attached the Google Form below required to submit to the Showcase and will be reaching out for any further steps after reviewing your entry.
Let me know if you have any questions or concerns!
Yours,
Connie
